# MELPA Submission Checklist

This document outlines the steps completed to make org-opml ready for MELPA submission.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Quality and Compliance
- [x] Added proper package headers to both `org-opml.el` and `ox-opml.el`
- [x] Enabled lexical binding (`;;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-`)
- [x] Added comprehensive docstrings to all functions
- [x] Added proper `;;;###autoload` cookies
- [x] Fixed deprecated function usage (`find-file-hooks` ‚Üí `find-file-hook`)
- [x] Ensured GPL-compatible licensing with proper boilerplate

### 2. Pure Elisp Implementation
- [x] **MAJOR CHANGE**: Removed Python dependency completely
- [x] Rewrote OPML parsing using Emacs' built-in `xml.el`
- [x] Maintained 100% compatibility with existing functionality
- [x] All conversion logic now in pure Elisp

### 3. Package Structure
- [x] Main package file: `org-opml.el`
- [x] Export backend: `ox-opml.el`
- [x] Proper `Package-Requires` headers
- [x] Version information and metadata
- [x] URL and homepage information

### 4. Testing and Validation
- [x] Verified parsing works correctly with example files
- [x] Confirmed output matches expected format exactly
- [x] Tested both simple (nba.opml) and complex (attributes.opml) examples
- [x] Verified file format conversion works in both directions

### 5. Documentation
- [x] Updated README.org with MELPA installation instructions
- [x] Added migration notes for users upgrading from Python version
- [x] Comprehensive feature documentation
- [x] Usage examples and explanations

### 6. MELPA Recipe
- [x] Created `org-opml-recipe` file with proper format
- [x] Specified correct files to include
- [x] Used appropriate fetcher (github)

## üìã Next Steps for MELPA Submission

1. **Fork MELPA repository**: https://github.com/melpa/melpa
2. **Add recipe file**: Copy `org-opml-recipe` to `recipes/org-opml` in MELPA repo
3. **Test locally**: Use MELPA's build scripts to test the package builds correctly
4. **Submit Pull Request**: Create PR with the new recipe file
5. **Address feedback**: Respond to any maintainer feedback

## üîç Key Improvements Made

### Before (Python-dependent)
- Required Python 3 runtime
- External script dependency
- Complex installation process
- Cross-platform compatibility issues

### After (Pure Elisp)
- No external dependencies
- Self-contained Elisp package
- Simple MELPA installation
- Better Emacs integration
- Improved error handling

## üìÅ Files for MELPA

The following files will be included in the MELPA package:
- `org-opml.el` - Main package file with format registration and parsing
- `ox-opml.el` - Org export backend for OPML conversion

## ‚ú® Features Preserved

All original functionality has been preserved:
- Bidirectional OPML ‚Üî Org conversion
- Support for headlines, lists, and paragraphs
- Property drawer ‚Üí OPML attributes conversion
- HTML entity escaping
- OPML 2.0 specification compliance
- Export via `C-c C-e m`

## üéØ MELPA Compliance

The package now meets all MELPA requirements:
- ‚úÖ GPL-compatible license
- ‚úÖ Proper package headers
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies
- ‚úÖ Quality code with documentation
- ‚úÖ Lexical binding enabled
- ‚úÖ Follows Emacs Lisp conventions
- ‚úÖ Autoload cookies for entry points
- ‚úÖ Reasonable package name and structure
